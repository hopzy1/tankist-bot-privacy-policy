## 🛠️ Data Collection

Our bot collects and processes the following data:  
- **Messages containing filtered words**: Messages that match custom filter rules are temporarily processed and logged in a private logging channel.  
- **Server settings**: Includes list of filtered words and the logging channel designated by server admin.

---

## 🔍 Data Usage

Collected data is used strictly for the following purposes:  
1. **Moderation**: Helping administrators enforce rules and detect violations.  
2. **Notifications**: Sending logs to a server-defined channel to inform moderators about violations.

**Note**: Logs are stored **only** in the logging channel and are never shared outside the server.

---

## 🔒 Data Storage

- **Temporary Logs**: Logged messages are sent to the logging channel on the same server. These logs are not stored beyond the lifetime of the bot's session.  
- **Configurations**: Server-specific settings, such as the filtered words and logging channel, are securely stored to enable bot functionality.  
- **No Permanent Storage**: We do not keep user messages on external databases or servers.

---

## ⚙️ User Control

- **Opt-in Moderation**: By default, the moderation feature is disabled. Administrators must explicitly enable it.  
- **Customizable Settings**: Administrators can:  
  - Define their own list of filtered words.  
  - Set the logging channel where violations will be reported.  
- **Removing the Bot**: If the bot is removed, all associated configurations and logs are deleted.

## 🔗 Data Sharing

We do **not** share any collected data with external services, third parties, or other servers.
